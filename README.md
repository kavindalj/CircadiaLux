👉 [CircadiaLux: Revolutionizing Healthcare Lighting with ML, IoT, and Human-Centered Design](https://blog.kavindalj.me/blog/CircadiaLux)

- **Frontend**: React application with Tailwind CSS providing interfaces for administrators and caretakers
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database storage, and real-time updates
- **IoT**: ESP32-based devices for monitoring and controlling lighting parameters
- **ML**: Machine learning component for personalized lighting recommendations

## System Architecture

![CircadiaLux System Architecture](architectureDiagram.png)

The CircadiaLux system follows a distributed architecture where:
- Healthcare professionals interact with the system through the React frontend
- Supabase serves as the central database and authentication hub
- ML service generates personalized lighting predictions triggered using Supabase webhooks and sends as JSON data to Flask API endpoint
- ESP32-based IoT devices control the physical lighting environment using sensor-based feedback loop control mechanism

## Component Documentation

- [Frontend README](frontend/README.md) - Setup and usage of the web application
- [IoT README](IoT/README.md) - Hardware specifications and firmware setup
- [ML README](ML/README.md) - Machine learning model information
- [Supabase README](supabase/README.md) - Database schema and configuration

## Installation and Setup

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kavindalj/CircadiaLux.git
cd CircadiaLux
```

For the best results, we recommend setting up the CircadiaLux system in the following order. For each component (except database), navigate to the component directory with `cd component-name` before following its setup instructions.

1. **Database Setup (Recommended First Step)**
   - Start with the Supabase configuration as it's the foundation of the system
   - Follow instructions in the [Supabase README](supabase/README.md)
   - This will create all necessary tables and security policies

2. **Machine Learning Component**
   - Set up the ML prediction service after the database
   - Follow instructions in the [ML README](ML/README.md)
   - Make sure to download a pre-trained model or train one yourself by following the provided steps.

3. **Frontend Application**
   - Configure and launch the web interface next
   - Follow instructions in the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md)
   - Connect to your Supabase instance using environment variables

4. **IoT Devices**
   - Finally, set up the physical hardware components
   - Follow instructions in the [IoT README](IoT/README.md)
   - Configure devices to connect to your Supabase instance

## System Requirements

- **Supabase**: Any tier (including free tier for development)
- **Frontend**: Node.js 18.x or later, npm 9.x or later
- **ML**: Python 3.10+, pip, and dependencies listed in requirements.txt
- **IoT**: PlatformIO, ESP32 development board, and supporting components
